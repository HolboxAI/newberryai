      "- Fever\n",
      "- Cough\n",
      "- Fatigue\n",
      "- Symptoms present for 5 days\n",

      "2. Differential Diagnosis:\n",
      "a) Viral respiratory infections (e.g., influenza, COVID-19, common cold)\n",
      "b) Bacterial pneumonia\n",
      "c) Acute bronchitis\n",
      "d) Atypical pneumonia (e.g., mycoplasma, chlamydia)\n",
      "e) Tuberculosis (less likely but possible)\n",
      "f) Non-infectious causes (e.g., exacerbation of chronic lung disease, malignancy)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Discussion of Top Considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "a) Viral respiratory infections:\n",
      "- Most common cause of these symptoms\n",
      "- Influenza and COVID-19 are particularly important to consider given their prevalence and potential severity\n",
      "- Typically self-limiting but can lead to complications\n",
      "\n",
      "b) Bacterial pneumonia:\n",
      "- Can cause more severe symptoms and may require antibiotic treatment\n",
      "- Often associated with more pronounced fever and productive cough\n",
      "\n",
      "c) Acute bronchitis:\n",
      "- Often viral in origin\n",
      "- Typically presents with cough as the predominant symptom\n",
      "\n",
      "d) Atypical pneumonia:\n",
      "- Can present with a more gradual onset and less severe symptoms\n",
      "- May not have classic chest X-ray findings of bacterial pneumonia\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Suggested Diagnostic Approach:\n",
      "1) Detailed history: Travel history, vaccination status, exposure to sick contacts, occupational exposures\n",
      "2) Physical examination: Vital signs (including oxygen saturation), lung auscultation, assessment of hydration status\n",
      "3) Laboratory tests:\n",
      "   - Complete blood count (CBC)\n",
      "   - C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)\n",
      "   - Influenza and COVID-19 testing\n",
      "4) Chest X-ray if pneumonia is suspected\n",
      "5) Blood cultures if bacterial infection is strongly suspected or patient appears septic\n",
      "6) Sputum culture if productive cough is present\n",

      "Certainly! I'll provide you with an Excel formula to calculate the average sales for the years 2010 and 2011 based on the information you've given. Here's the formula:\n",
      "\n",
      "=AVERAGEIFS(A:A, B:B, \"2010\", B:B, \"2011\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break down this formula and explain its components:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. AVERAGEIFS: This is an advanced Excel function that calculates the average of cells that meet multiple criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. A:A: This is the range where your sales data is located (Column A).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. B:B: This is the first criteria range, where the year data is located (Column B).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. \"2010\": This is the first criterion, specifying that we want to include data from 2010.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. B:B: This is the second criteria range, which is the same as the first (Column B for years).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. \"2011\": This is the second criterion, specifying that we also want to include data from 2011.\n",
      "\n",
      "How it works:\n",
      "The formula will look at each cell in column A (sales data) and only include it in the average if the corresponding cell in column B contains either \"2010\" or \"2011\". It then calculates the average of all the sales figures that meet these criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional notes:\n",
      "1. This formula assumes that your years in Column B are formatted as text (e.g., \"2010\" instead of 2010). If they are formatted as numbers, remove the quotation marks from the formula.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The formula uses entire column references (A:A and B:B). If your data is in a specific range, you can replace these with the exact ranges (e.g., A2:A1000 and B2:B1000).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Although you mentioned that months are in Column C, this information isn't needed for the specific calculation you requested. If you need to include months in your criteria later, you can add additional conditions to the AVERAGEIFS function.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Make sure your sales data in Column A is formatted as numbers for accurate calculations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To use this formula, simply enter it into any cell in your Excel worksheet, and it will calculate the average sales for 2010 and 2011 combined.\n"

ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) stacks are employed for log aggregation. • Test Automation: Selenium and JMeter are utilized for automated UI and load testing, respectively. • Data Analytics: Python libraries (such as Pandas and Matplotlib) analyze collected performance metrics. Performance Metrics and Data Collection Key performance metrics include: • Response Time: Average time taken by the application to process a request. • Throughput: The number of transactions processed per second. • Error Rate: Frequency of system errors or failed requests. • Resource Utilization: Metrics relating to CPU, memory, and network usage. Data is continuously collected by instrumentation probes that feed into a centralized data repository. The repository serves as the backend for real-time dashboards and automated alerting systems. The study emphasizes filtering and aggregating this massive dataset to derive actionable insights. Simulation Setup and Execution The simulation is designed to mimic real-world events. Multiple scenarios are executed, including: • Normal Operation: Routine system loads are applied to understand baseline performance. • Stress Testing: Simulated spikes in user activity test system endurance. • Component Failure: Specific microservices are taken offline to examine how the system detects and responds to failures.\n",

By highlighting actionable insights and providing a detailed case study demonstration, this paper contributes to the ongoing dialogue about creating resilient, scalable, and high-performing systems. Software development teams can use these insights to design systems that automatically monitor, diagnose, and react to performance issues, thereby ensuring a seamless transition from development to operations. LITERATURE REVIEW The evolution of performance monitoring techniques has paralleled the advancements in software development practices. Early techniques predominantly involved manual testing and benchmarking, focusing on isolated metrics such as response time or throughput under controlled conditions. Researchers and practitioners, however, soon recognized that static testing environments could not capture the full spectrum of behaviors in production systems. With the advent of DevOps, the need to embed performance monitoring throughout the software lifecycle has come to the forefront. Historical Perspectives and Evolution Early works in performance engineering primarily investigated performance as an afterthought—a quality assurance measure used to validate whether the application met its stipulated performance targets. Classic studies, such as Jain’s “The Art of Computer Systems Performance Analysis,” laid the groundwork by highlighting systematic approaches to performance testing and analysis. However, these methodologies were not designed to be part of a continuous feedback loop, which is essential for real-time monitoring. With the digital transformation and the adoption of agile development cycles, seminal research began focusing on incorporating continuous performance evaluation mechanisms within CI/CD pipelines. The shift was motivated by the need to detect performance issues during development phases, reducing the time and cost needed for remedial actions. This change has been documented in various studies discussing the integration of automated monitoring tools and performance testing frameworks into DevOps environments.
