# NewberryAI

A Python package for medical scribing using AWS Transcribe Medical service.

## Overview

HealthScribe is a package focused on the healthcare domain. It enables medical scribing by transcribing audio files (e.g., doctor-patient conversations) using AWS Transcribe Medical service. The package uploads the provided audio file to an S3 bucket, starts a transcription job, and retrieves a summary from the job's JSON output.

## Installation

```sh
 pip install newberryai
```
## Usage

You can use the command-line interface:

```bash
healthscribe-cli <audio_file> <job_name> <data_access_role_arn> <s3_bucket> 
```

For example:

```bash
healthscribe-cli conversation.wav myJob arn:aws:iam::aws_accountid:role/your-role my-s3-bucket s3-key
```

You can use this in python script: 
```sh 
import os
import newberryai

# Set the environment variables for the AWS SDK
os.environ['AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'] = aws_access_key_id
os.environ['AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] = aws_secret_access_key
os.environ['AWS_REGION'] = aws_region

# Healthscribe Functionality (Medical Transcription using AWS Healthscribe)

# Set the path to the audio file and other required parameters
audio_file = "/path/to/audio.mp3"  
job_name = "job_name" 
data_access_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::accountid:role/your-role"  
s3_bucket = "s3_bucket"  

# Call the Healthscribe function
summary = newberryai.healthscribe(
    audio_file=audio_file,
    job_name=job_name,
    data_access_role_arn=data_access_role_arn,
    s3_bucket=s3_bucket
)

print("Healthscribe Summary:")
print(summary)

# Compliance Checker Functionality (Compliance Check on a Video File)

# Set your video file path and compliance question
video_file = "/path/to/video.mp4"  
compliance_question = "Is the video compliant with safety regulations such as mask?" 

# Call the compliance-checker function
result = newberryai.check_compliance(
    video_file=video_file,
    prompt=compliance_question
)

# Print the compliance check result
print("Compliance Check Result:")
print(f"Analysis: {result['analysis']}")
print(f"Compliant: {result['compliant']}")

```
